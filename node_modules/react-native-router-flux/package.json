Docs could be found [here](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/blob/master/README3.md)\n\n___\n\nDefine all your routes in one place...\n\n```js\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Router>\n        <Scene key=\"root\">\n          <Scene key=\"login\" component={Login} title=\"Login\"/>\n          <Scene key=\"register\" component={Register} title=\"Register\"/>\n          <Scene key=\"home\" component={Home}/>\n        </Scene>\n      </Router>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...and navigate from scene to scene with a simple, powerful API\n\n```js\n// login.js\n\n// navigate to 'home' as defined in your top-level router\nActions.home(PARAMS)\n\n// go back (i.e. pop the current screen off the nav stack)\nActions.pop()\n\n// refresh the current Scene with the specified props\nActions.refresh({param1: 'hello', param2: 'world'})\n```\n\n\n## Try the example app\n\n![rnrf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3681859/27937441-ef61d932-626b-11e7-885f-1db7dc74b32e.gif)\n\n```bash\n# Get the code\ngit clone git@github.com:aksonov/react-native-router-flux.git`\ncd react-native-router-flux/Example\n\n# Install dependencies\nyarn\n\n# Run it\nreact-native run-ios\n```\n\n## v4 Features\n* Based on latest [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) API\n* Separate navigation logic from presentation. You may change now navigation state directly from your business logic code - stores/reducers/etc. navigationStore\n* Built-in state machine (v3 `Switch` replacement) - each ‘scene’ could have onEnter/onExit handlers. onEnter handler could be async. For successful termination of onEnter, `success` handler (if defined) will be executed (if `success` is string then router will navigation to that Scene), in case of handler's failure `failure` (if defined) will be run. It will allow to build authentication, data validation and conditional transitions in very easy way.\n* MobX-powered, all used scenes are wrapped as 'observer' automatically. You may subscribe to navigationStore (former Actions), observe current navigation state, etc. If you are using Redux, skip this.\n* Flexible nav bar customization, that is not allowed by react navigation right now:\nhttps://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/779\n* Drawer support (provided by reactnavigation)\n* Inheritance of scene attributes allow you to avoid any code/attribute duplications. If you send rightTitle it will be shown in all children.\n* Access to your app navigations state as simple as `Actions.state`, use `Actions.currentScene` to get name of current scene.\n\n## Breaking changes (compared to v3):\n* `Actions.create` (alternative syntax to define scenes) is not available (for simplicity) - just use `<Router>` as top component for your App. You may wrap it with Redux as well.\n* No `duration`/`panHandlers` support - you have to implement custom navigator now instead and pass it as ‘navigator’ prop\nhttps://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/custom. You could still pass `panHandlers={null}` to disable gestures or `gesturedEnabled={false}`\n* No `component` support for scene containers (that contains children `Scene`) - you have to use custom navigator\n* No support for partial hiding of tab bar for some tabs because of react navigation bug (react navigation issue):\nhttps://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1584\n* No possibility to skip animation during reset/replace (react navigation issue):\nhttps://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1493\n* `Switch` is removed - you may use onEnter/onExit handlers for more flexible logic.\n* `getSceneStyle` is removed (no needed in v4, you may pass any values to Router now and they will be inherited by all scenes).\n* Custom reducer is supported (`createReducer` prop for Router) but Redux actions now are passed directly from React Navigation (‘Navigation/BACK’, ‘Navigation/NAVIGATE’, etc.)\n* Drawer is 'drawer' attribute Scene\n* Modal is 'lightbox' attribute for Scene (used for popups, like Error)\n* Container scenes (that has children) cannot have `component` (or it will be considered as child!). If you want to customize containers, use react navigation custom navigators and pass it as `navigator` prop.\n* No `position` attribute is supported for custom transitions. For vertical transition add `modal` to parent `Scene`.\n* No flux 'focus' actions - use onEnter/onExit handlers instead.\n* tabBarSelectedItemStyle is not supported. Instead please use React Navigation TabBar params for tabs Scene: `activeTintColor`, `inactiveTintColor`, etc (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/tab)\n* Possible other stuff.\n\n## Migrating from v3\nComing soon\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
