  "readme": "# react-native-simple-sound\n\nReact Native module for playing, pausing, and stopping sound clips.\n\nDerived from Derived from [react-native-sound](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound), which allows multiple sound files to be played at once, but does not offer pause or stop.\n\n## Installation\n\n```javascript\nnpm install react-native-simple-sound --save\n```\n\nIn XCode, right click **Libraries**.\nClick **Add Files to \"[Your project]\"**.\nNavigate to **node_modules/react-native-simple-sound**.\nAdd the file **RNSimpleSound.xcodeproj**.\n\nIn the project navigator, select your project.\nClick the build target.\nClick **Build Phases**.\nExpand **Link Binary With Libraries**.\nClick the plus button and add **libRNSimpleSound.a** under **Workspace**.\n\nRun your project (âŒ˜+R).\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar Sound = require('react-native-simple-sound');\nSound.enable(true); // Enable sound\nSound.prepare('tap.aac'); // Preload the sound file 'tap.aac' in the app bundle\nSound.play(); // Play the sound 'tap.aac'\nSound.pause(); // Pause the sound\nSound.play(); // Resume playing the sound\nSound.stop(); // Stop and reset the sound.\n```\n\n## Notes\n- Sound.enable(true) must be called before playing any sound.\n- Sound.prepare(...) must be called before playing - preloads a sound file and prepares it for playback.\n- To change sounds, stop() the current sound and call prepare() with the new sound.\n- The module wraps AVAudioPlayer which supports aac, aiff, mp3, wav etc. The full list of supported formats can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html).\n- The stop() function resets the sound back to the beginning, this is different from the standard behavior of AVAudioPlayer\n- Sound files must be in the bundle (in your app's main folder in Xcode)\n",
