Link\n\n```\n    react-native link react-native-sound-player\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n\n### Play sound with file name and type\n\n1. Add sound files to iOS/Android.\n\n  - On iOS, drag and drop sound file into project in Xcode. Remember to check \"Copy items if needed\" option.\n  - On Android, put sound files in {project_root}/android/app/src/main/res/raw/. Just create the folder if it doesn't exist.\n\n\n2. Import the library and call the `playSoundFile(fileName, fileType)` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport SoundPlayer from 'react-native-sound-player';\n\n// play the file tone.mp3\ntry {\n  SoundPlayer.playSoundFile('tone', 'mp3');\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(`cannot play the sound file`, e);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Finished playing event\n\n```javascript\n...\n\n// subscribe to the finished playing event in componentDidMount\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  SoundPlayer.onFinishedPlaying((success: boolean) => { // success is true when the sound is played\n    console.log('finished playing', success);\n  });\n}\n\n// unsubscribe when unmount\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n  SoundPlayer.unmount();\n}\n\n\n}\n\n...\n```\n\n\n## Function\n\n### playSound(fileName: string, fileType: string)\nPlay the sound file named `fileName` with file type `fileType`.\n\n### onFinishedPlaying(callback: (success: boolean) => any)\nSubscribe to the \"finished playing\" event. The `callback` function is called ever a file is finished playing.\n\n### unmount()\nUnsubscribe the \"finished playing\" event.\n",
